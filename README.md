# MasterMind 2.0

MasterMind 2.0 is a program written in C inspired by the classical game (not finished yet).

This is a complete project which means that all the resources are include (images, sounds, fonts, DLL...).

You will just have to compile the code (I did it with Code::Blocs) and enjoy the game ;)

I'm a newbie in programming, so if you have any comments, don't hesitate to let me know :)
